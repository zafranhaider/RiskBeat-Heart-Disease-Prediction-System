Project Proposal
Project Title: Heart Disease Risk Prediction System
Introduction:
The health care industries collect huge amounts of data that contain some hidden information, which is useful for making effective decisions. For providing appropriate results and making effective decisions on data, some advanced data mining techniques are used. This Heart Disease Risk Prediction System is developed using gradient boosting and Logistic regression algorithms for predicting the risk level of heart disease. The system uses 13 medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity for prediction. The Heart Disease Risk Prediction System predicts the likelihood of patients getting heart disease. It enables significant knowledge. E.g. Relationships between medical factors related to heart disease and patterns, to be established. We have employed the multilayer perceptron neural network with back propagation as the training algorithm. The obtained results have illustrated that the designed diagnostic system can effectively predict the risk level of heart diseases.

Existing System/ Description of the Current Situation: 
Currently, heart disease is a major health issue, but there aren't many efficient systems to predict it early. Most medical diagnoses rely on expensive tests and doctor consultations, which may not be affordable for everyone. Even though a lot of healthcare data is available (like patient records, test results, and images), this data is not fully utilized for predictions. As a result, early detection of heart problems is often missed, leading to more serious health issues and costly treatments.

Problem Statement:
Now days, heart disease is the most common disease. But, unfortunately the treatment of heart disease is somewhat costly that is not affordable by common man and heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early diagnosis can significantly improve treatment outcomes, but current methods are often expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible to many individuals. Despite the availability of large amounts of healthcare data, it is underutilized for predictive analysis. There is a need for a cost-effective and efficient system to predict the likelihood of heart disease early, using patient data like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical indicators. Such a system can assist healthcare providers in making accurate, data-driven decisions to improve patient care and reduce treatment costs.

Proposed Solution: 
We can reduce this problem in some amount just by predicting heart disease before it becomes dangerous using Heart Disease Risk Prediction System. If we can find out heart disease problem in early stages then it becomes very helpful for treatment. Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques are used for the construction of Heart Disease Risk Prediction System. In healthcare biomedical field, there is large use of heath care data in the form of text, images, etc. but, that data is hardly visited and is not mined. So, we can avoid this problem by introducing Heart Disease Risk Prediction System. This system will help us reduce the costs and to enhance the quality treatment of heart patients. This system can able to identify complex problems and can able to take intelligent medical decisions. The system can predict likelihood of patients of getting heart problems by their profiles such as blood pressure, age, sex, cholesterol and blood sugar. Also, the performance will be compared by calculation of confusion matrix. This can help to calculate accuracy, precision, and recall. The overall system provides high performance and better accuracy.

Scope of the Project: 
	Role-Based Logins (Admin, User, Doctor): 		
Admin: Manages the system, user accounts, and data.
Doctor: Views patient predictions and provides medical advice.
User: Submits personal health data and views prediction results.
	Disease Prediction: 
o	This module predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

o	Provides personalized insights for early diagnosis and better treatment planning.
	View Diseases:
o	Displays information about various heart diseases, their symptoms, causes, and treatment options.
o	Helps users and doctors understand potential risks and make informed decisions.
	Search Your Doctor: 
o	Allows users to search for doctors specializing in heart-related conditions based on their location or expertise.
o	Provides contact details and availability for consultations.
