## Introduction
The Heart Disease Risk Prediction System leverages advanced data mining and machine learning techniques to analyze medical parameters and predict the risk level of heart disease. It utilizes algorithms like Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression along with a multilayer perceptron neural network for high-performance prediction accuracy. The system uses 13 medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, and obesity for prediction.

---

## Existing System
Currently, heart disease diagnoses rely on:
- Expensive tests and consultations.
- Underutilized healthcare data.
- Limited accessibility for many individuals.

These challenges often delay early diagnosis, leading to costly treatments and severe health outcomes.

## Problem Statement
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Despite the abundance of healthcare data, it is often underutilized for predictive analysis. Current diagnostic methods are expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible, highlighting the need for a cost-effective, efficient system for early detection of heart disease.

---

## Proposed Solution
The Heart Disease Risk Prediction System addresses these challenges by:
- Using patient profiles (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol) to predict the likelihood of heart disease.
- Employing machine learning techniques for accurate risk classification.
- Enhancing healthcare decision-making through data-driven insights.
- Improving treatment affordability and outcomes.
